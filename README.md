## 🚀 Project Overview

This project delivers a full analytical deep-dive into US labor market conditions between 2022–2024, transforming raw labor statistics into interactive dashboards, state-level visualizations, and data-driven insights.
Built with a blend of Python, Pandas, Plotly, and modern BI principles, the dashboard highlights unemployment trends, workforce participation, and regional disparities through a clean and intuitive design.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate end-to-end analytical thinking:
from data cleaning → feature engineering → visualization → storytelling → insight generation.

## 🎯 Key Questions Answered

- How did US unemployment evolve between 2022–2024?

- Which regions and states experienced the most labor market stability or stress?

- Are unemployment and labor force participation correlated?

- What signals of cooling or tightening can be detected across quarters?

- How do structural differences across regions shape workforce dynamics?

📌 Highlights & Insights

✔️ Unemployment remained historically low (~3.45%), signalling a tight labor market.

✔️ Midwest emerged as the most stable region, with the West facing persistent unemployment pressure.

✔️ Early 2024 shows mild softening, aligning with macroeconomic cooling following interest rate hikes.

✔️ Participation trends remained steady, reflecting demographic rather than economic drivers.

✔️ State-level analysis exposes strong geographic disparities, revealing hidden pockets of vulnerability.

These insights combine to offer a nuanced picture of a market that is strong but uneven, resilient yet showing early signs of moderated growth.
